Between me Rick Chen
and you [customer name] 

## Summary: 

I will always do our best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it's important to have things written down so that we both know what's what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won't find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I have no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What I do want is what's best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] are hiring me (Rick Chen) to [design and develop a web application] for the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence. Of course it's a little more complicated, but I will get to that.

## What do both parties agree to do? 

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You'll give us everything we need to complete the project as and when and in the format we need it. You'll review my work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you'll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

*Me:* I have the experience and ability to do everything we've agreed with you and I will do it all in a professional and timely manner. I will endeavour to meet every deadline that's set and on top of that I will maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.

## Getting down to the nitty gritty 

### Design 

I can create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I can create designs iteratively and use predominantly HTML, CSS and Javascript so we won't waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. I may use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (color, texture and typography.)

You'll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. I will share our working folder or Github repo with you and have regular, possibly daily contact. If, at any stage, you are not happy with the direction my work is taking, you will pay me in full for everything I have produced until that point and cancel this contract.

### Text content 

I am not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If you would like me to write new content or input text for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Photographs 

You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you'd like me to search for photographs for you, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Final Product - HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I will provide to you html, css and javascript files to your specifications.

### Browser testing

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing

I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Mobile browser testing

Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person's experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they are using. I can test my work in:

iOS: Safari, Google Chrome 
Android 4.x: Google Chrome and Firefox

I currently do not test Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, Windows Phone or other mobile browsers. If you need me to test using these, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Technical support

I am not a website hosting company so I do not offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don't, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers. We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics and we can provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you. 

### Changes and revisions 

I know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. I don't want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we'll need to accomplish everything you've told us you want to achieve, but I am happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won't be a problem as I will provide a separate estimate for that.

### Legal stuff 

I can't guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I cannot be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you have advised me of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
 
Phew.

### Copyrights 

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you have permission to use them.

Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You will own the visual elements that we create for this project. I will give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I am not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them. 

I will own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and I will license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

I would love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so I reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

### Payments 

I am sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. As I am also sure you will want to stay friends, you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule.

[Payment schedule]

### But where's all the horrible small print? 

Just like a parking ticket, you can't transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place. 

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of United States courts.
